  Hi! I'm Juen Wei, a recent university graduate and I am extremely excited to start my career in data analytics. I have always been interested in using data to understand patterns and trends, and I believe that a career in data analytics will allow me to do just that. I enjoy problem solving and am always looking for ways to increase my skillset in order to solve complex problems.
